Steps to Create Your YouTube Movies
1. Define Tools and Platforms
Video Editing Software: Do you have access to tools like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Canva Pro (with video features), or free tools like DaVinci Resolve or CapCut? If not, I can guide you through choosing one.
Graphic Design for Static Elements: Tools like Canva, Photoshop, or even PowerPoint can help design slides that serve as static frames.
2. Create Static Frames
I can help design templates for:
"Open" and "Closed" frames.
Static sections like your pharmacy logo, address, hours, and supervising pharmacist info.
Let me know what style (e.g., professional, vibrant, minimalist) you prefer.
3. Dynamic Sections
For animations like the rotating blister packs, moving delivery truck, and syringe icon, I can provide:
Ready-to-use scripts for animations.
Image assets or references if you're using a specific tool.
4. Script and Storyboarding
I can create a detailed script and storyboard for both the "open" and "closed" videos. This will specify the text, animations, and transitions for each frame.
5. Background Music
I can suggest free or royalty-free music sources suitable for the videos (e.g., upbeat for open hours, calming for closed hours).
